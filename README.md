# 🏺 CraveQ: The Molecular Ghost of Your Greatest Cravings.

> **"Cooking is the art of transformation; CraveQ is the map for the journey."**

CraveQ is a culinary exploration tool designed to decode the mystery of human taste. By blending the precision of modern data with the "alchemy" of cooking, CraveQ helps you understand exactly why you crave what you crave and how to achieve the perfect flavor balance.

## 🧪 The Vision: Taste as Alchemy

Most recipes tell you **what** to cook, but they don't explain **why** a dish works. CraveQ treats cooking as a form of "flavor transmutation." 

We believe that every craving is a puzzle of five core elements: **Sweet, Salty, Sour, Bitter, and Umami.** CraveQ is built to help you visualize these elements, allowing you to map out your palate and discover the hidden formulas behind your favorite meals.

## ✨ Key Concepts

* **Flavor Mapping**: Move beyond simple ingredient lists. Visualize the "shape" of a dish's flavor profile to see if it’s hitting the right notes or if it’s missing a crucial element.
* **The Alchemical Balance**: Learn how to use "counter-agents"—like using acidity (**Sour**) to cut through richness (**Umami**) or using **Salt** to diminish **Bitterness**.
* **Crave Analysis**: A dedicated interface to help you identify what your body is actually looking for when you say, *"I'm hungry for something... I just don't know what."*
* **Intuitive Discovery**: An aesthetic, atmospheric design that makes flavor theory feel less like a chemistry textbook and more like a creative journey.

## 🎨 The Experience

The CraveQ interface is designed to be **dark, immersive, and tactile.** It moves away from standard spreadsheets and boring forms, opting instead for a "Laboratory" feel. Users can experiment with flavor sliders and visual charts to "brew" their ideal meal profile, making the science of taste feel like an art form.

## 🍎 Who is CraveQ for?

* **The Home Chef**: Who wants to learn how to fix a dish that "tastes like it's missing something."
* **The Food Enthusiast**: Who wants to track and analyze the flavor profiles of the world's best restaurants.
* **The Curious Eater**: Who wants a deeper, more mindful relationship with the food they consume every day.
